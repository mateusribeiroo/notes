# Next Level Week Project

## What i learned?

I already knew about some functionalities of React but i became more confident after this project.
Learned how to use hooks better, and met various libraries that help a lot to build a good application.

This was my first time using tailwind and i loved it. Im sure will keep using it in my future projects.

Also was my first time using SpeechRecognitionAPI and it was way more simple that i expected. Very usefull and interesting.

## Libs I used
- lucid (for icons)
- sonner (for toasts)
- date-fns (to deal with timestamps)
- radix (to create UI more efficiently)
- tailwind (for styles and patterns)
